Muoi Tran is a Ph.D. candidate of the \href{http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/about/depts/cs/}{Computer Science Department} at \href{http://nus.edu.sg/}{National University of Singapore}. 
His research aims to enchance the network and blockchain security with a focus on the underlying Internet infrastructure.

% He proposed an adaptive distributed denial-of-service attack with the power increased by exploiting the routing protocol.
% Muoi also discovered a stealthy partitioning attack on Bitcoinâ€™s network that would influence the future network design of several cryptocurrencies.

% Muoi Tran has been publishing papers in highly reputable computer security conferences, including venues such as IEEE S\&P. 
% He is the first NUS student in the last 10 years who has published two first-author papers at this privileged conference.
